    Curse: Five sprites can collectively curse a target (no attack roll; save versus spells). The effect is determined by the referee, but will always be used to comical effect (e.g. target trips, target’s nose grows).
    Pranksters: Even if attacked, sprites have no interest in killing, merely in making practical jokes.
